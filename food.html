    The first 3 pictures are all food from a Taiwanese food truck called Song La. I got pork belly buns, tofu fries, braised pork
    rice, and the bento box with pork chops. The last picture shows street tacos from Jefes Street Tacos, a Mexican food truck.

    The first two pictures are from Delicious Thai. I tried out the Pad Thai, which is shown in the first picture, and Pad See Ew in
    the next photo. Ice Scrapers recently opened up at the Co-op Food Court, and they make customized rolled up ice cream as well 
    as shaved ice. The last picture is spicy beef noodle soup from Coco's Cafe.

    The first picture is a mocha and cinnamon roll from Caffe Amici. Chilantro is a Mexican-Asian fusion place known for its kimchi 
    fries, shown in the second picture. I got to try out Cajun food from ATX Boudain Hut, where I got the boiled crawfish basket only
    available on Saturdays during the spring. Taco Joint is near my apartment, so I went over to try it out. I got a steak/potato/egg 
    breakfast taco and a fried fish taco.
