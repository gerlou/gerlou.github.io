    About Me
  </h1>
    
  </header>
  
  <p>
    I am currently a computer science student at The University of Texas at Austin. I like to attend concerts, listen to music,
    and watch comedy TV shows. My favorite shows are How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, Arrested Development, and
    Modern Family. I like listening to pop music and some country. This summer I have also gotten into baking and cooking, and I hope
    to improve my skills more so I can cook myself meals at my apartment next year in Austin. I'm also a huge foodie and love to
    try new places. Food makes everything better.

    Daily Life: In the mornings, I work out and then shower. Sometimes I'll go drive to buy food for lunch and then in the afternoon,
    I'll make food to eat for later. I love using body lotions from Bath and Body Works, since the scent just makes me feel more 
    awake and confident. I like to end the night by watching Modern Family.

    I go to college in Austin, TX. Some people might think Austin doesn't have much but it definitely has its own vibe.
