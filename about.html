    About Me
  </h1>
    
  </header>
  
  <p>
    I am currently a computer science student at The University of Texas at Austin. I like to attend concerts, listen to music,
    and watch comedy TV shows. My favorite shows are How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, Arrested Development, and
    Modern Family. I like listening to pop music like Ariana Grande and Katy Perry. I like to cook and have been cooking almost all of my 
    meals myself at my apartment. I'm also a huge foodie and love to try new places.

    Daily Life:  My schedule throughout the week is like that of most other college students: go to class, come home, work on homework, 
    and try to fit in time for social activities. This semester I joined Alpha Phi Omega and it's really been an interesting experience 
    since I never thought I would join APO or any kind of fraternity. When I'm not working on CS projects, I spend time volunteering
    at events and making more friendships at family nights for APO.

    I go to college in Austin, TX. Some people might think Austin doesn't have much but it definitely has its own vibe.
